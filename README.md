# Welcome to garbage-collection - repo of nothing

Here I collect all stuff, which I do for coding practice. It might cover academic exercises, online courses, puzzles, small tasks and more.

Currently I try to finish [Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/java) Java exercises.

The format, which I used for exercises present as follows:

```java
public class Exercise {                            // exercise name
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(exercise_method(2,2));      // getting result: 4
	}
	public static int exercise_method(int a, int b) {
		return a + b;                   // copy the inner content of the method to test it in Coding Bat editor. 
	}
}
```

I'm still beginner though. I know I still don't know much, but I wanna improve within time. :chart_with_upwards_trend:
